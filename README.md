# Space-Aliens-Final
!!!! You need to have installed pygame on your device to use this program.
I made this program for my final project for programming 1 my sophomore year. It is kind of like space invaders. 

The final program I did for my programming class my sophomore year was basically an arcade game. I have always wanted to write my own code
for a game and this was my chance. It is a game where you have a little space ship at the bottom of the screen that moves left and right 
with the arrow keys. There are also enemies that move at a random spot down the screen towards the ship. You are meant to avoid them. You
can also hit the space bar and you will shoot a bullet which will make the enemy disappear. If an enemy hits the ship then you lose. I 
used a graphics system called pygame to display it as you can see in my source code.
